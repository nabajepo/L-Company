# Tools
We use Maven, Java, a web service (RESTful), MySQL, and the local Tomcat server to create a web application.

# Description
This project allows the user to create an account (email address, name, password) in L-Company.
Once the account is created, the user can log in and view other members of the company (they can only see their email address and name).
This project can be useful if a user wants to contact a colleague but is unable to do so because they only have their name. The user can log in and look up their email address.

# Architectural Pattern
This project uses an MVC-like pattern.
